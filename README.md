# Cuber - [(Video)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K8QNXNZYxWQ)
Cuber is an automatic rubiks cube robot that can read the state of a 3x3 cube and solve it using servo motors.

Cuber was funded by and built for Hack Club's [Highway](https://highway.hackclub.com) program. You can read my journal [here](./JOURNAL.md). 

Want to make your own? Find documentation on how to build it [here](./docs/README.md).

I've spent over 120 hours designing and building Cuber. Read my thoughts [here](./REFLECTION.md). (TBA)
